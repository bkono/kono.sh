        <p>Bringing docker into the picture for deployments to production has a number of great benefits. A key
one of those is the fact that we can work with the same container locally as we will during a
deployment to prod. In a distributed system composed of multiple services, this benefit grows exponentially if
we invest a little time up front to integrate system testing on our local development environments.
Being able to snag down all of the current containers deployed to prod is a great first step, but
you&rsquo;ll quickly find a few gaps remain. In this series of articles on a prod-like development flow,
we&rsquo;ll attempt to tackle all of the major points with a description of the tool, why you need it, and
how to get it all setup. If all goes according to plan (always does, right?) then we&rsquo;ll end up with
a simple set of commands to spin up an almost replica of production, execute system-wide integration
specs, and even browse to it on a local subdomain for the always needed but much maligned manual
testing.</p>

<p>As posts are completed, I&rsquo;ll keep the TOC below updated. Keep an eye out for frequent updates over
the next couple weeks.</p>
