<h3 id="dns-for-development-just-like-your-production-setup">DNS for development just like your production setup</h3>

<p>dnsmasq is one part of the equation to making our development environments behave like a production
environment.  Instead of coding in URLs like <a href="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080/</a> we want to provide
<a href="http://testing.coolwebsite.dev/">http://testing.coolwebsite.dev/</a>.  This way we can have websites hosted on subdomains where we browse
and function locally, the same as you will with a production environment.  In addition, we are
planning to use <a href="https://www.consul.io">Consul</a> for service discovery which leverages DNS. This post
solves the DNS problem associated with this flow.  In order to completely get the
<a href="http://12factor.net/dev-prod-parity">dev-prod</a> parity, additional tools will be necessary, such as
load balancers or reverse proxies (think nginx and watch for a follow up post to elaborate).</p>

<h3 id="the-setup">The Setup</h3>

<pre><code>brew up
brew install dnsmasq
cp /usr/local/opt/dnsmasq/dnsmasq.conf.example /usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf
sudo cp -fv /usr/local/opt/dnsmasq/*.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons
sudo chown root /Library/LaunchDaemons/homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq.plist
sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq.plist
</code></pre>

<p>At this point you now a have locally running dns server.  Let&rsquo;s go configure it so that we can browse like we are in a production environment.</p>

<p>We need to tell our DNS server where to lookup hostnames for our development environment.  I
typically use a domain name with a .dev top level domain.  For instance when working on <a href="http://www.client.com">http://www.client.com</a> my test domain is client.dev.  This is configured by adding the name address pair as follows:</p>

<pre><code>sed -i.bak '/#address=\/double-click\.net\/127\.0\.0\.1/a\
  address=/client.dev/192.168.59.103\' /usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf
</code></pre>

<p>The whitespace in this command for OSX must match exactly or you will discover the GNU vs BSD sed differences. As an alternative you can just open /usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf in your favorite editor and append this line.</p>

<p>This setup is preparing us to pair with <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">Docker Compose</a>. If you are not going to use Docker Compose, then you probably just want to use the loopback address as below:</p>

<pre><code>sed -i.bak '/#address=\/double-click\.net\/127\.0\.0\.1/a\
  address=/client.dev/127.0.0.1' /usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf
</code></pre>

<p>Finally in order to get these changes into dnsmasq we need to restart the server with:</p>

<pre><code>sudo launchctl stop homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq
sudo launchctl start homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq
</code></pre>

<p>Just to make sure we are working let&rsquo;s test with dig:</p>

<pre><code>dig this.is.totally.using.local.client.dev @127.0.0.1
</code></pre>

<p>The response should be very quick and contain something similar to:</p>

<pre><code>;; ANSWER SECTION:
this.is.totally.using.local.client.dev. 0    IN      A       192.168.59.103
</code></pre>

<p>If you were configuring for pure local not boot2docker the 192.168.59.103 would
be 127.0.0.1.</p>

<h3 id="resolve-all-the-things">Resolve all the things</h3>

<p>Now that we have a DNS server running and configured locally, we need to tell OSX how to use dnsmasq. There are a couple of options, but we are going to keep this simple and use resolvers to only affect the client.dev domain.</p>

<p>For more information on what we are about to do see the resolver(5) manual page:</p>

<pre><code>man 5 resolver
</code></pre>

<p>We need a new resolver file, but first make sure you have an /etc/resolver/
directory, if not make one with:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir /etc/resolver/
</code></pre>

<p>Then lets quickly make the file:</p>

<pre><code>sudo tee /etc/resolver/coolwebsite.dev &gt;/dev/null &lt;&lt;EOF
nameserver 127.0.0.1
EOF
</code></pre>

<p>This file tells OSX to ask our local dns server for any domain in coolwebsite.dev. We should do a quick test make sure all this works:</p>

<pre><code>ping -c 1 www.google.com
</code></pre>

<p>This verifies we didn&rsquo;t break our original DNS. You&rsquo;re good to go if you see something like:</p>

<pre><code>PING www.google.com (74.125.20.105): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 74.125.20.105: icmp_seq=0 ttl=45 time=34.782 ms
</code></pre>

<p>Now we should test something new:</p>

<pre><code>ping -c 1 this.will.go.to.my.coolwebsite.dev 
</code></pre>

<p>Success will look similar to:</p>

<pre><code>PING this.will.go.to.my.coolwebsite.dev (192.168.59.103): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 192.168.59.103: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=2.973 ms
</code></pre>

<p>If you configured that for local host you should see 127.0.0.1 instead of the
192.</p>

<p>Finally if you are super lazy and trust me 100 % you can use a bash script to automate this similar to the one you see <a href="https://gist.github.com/moofish32/1594c43bdbde2e714ff9#file-dnsmasq_docker-sh">here</a></p>
